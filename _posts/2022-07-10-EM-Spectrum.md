The light that is captured by the unaided human eye is a sliver of the many variations of light frequencies that exist in the electromagnetic spectrum.

The various frequencies of light have varying properties. Infrared, Microwave, and radio waves have longer wavelengths which are more likely to pass through things like the atmosphere, walls, and most other other matter that shorter frequenices of light are unable to. 

Shorter wavelengths of light like Ultraviolet, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays tend to carry more energy, and would be harmful to humans. Fortunately, this type of light cannot pass through the atmostphere. However, this makes it difficult to see to detect celestial objects that mostly emit light of lower wavelengths from Earth.
