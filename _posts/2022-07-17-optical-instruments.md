Earth's atmosphere serves as a blanket for the planet, and prevents higher frequency light from touching Earth's surface. However, this makes it impossible to view celestial objects clearly, especially if they emit high-energy light.

Thus, space telescopes like the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, Hubble, and now the James Webb space telescopes are created. They provide details and observations that most ground telescopes are unable to.
