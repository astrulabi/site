 The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, which means that most distant extra-galactic objects in every direction are progressively moving away from us. This causes a phenomena known as redshift amongst these stellar objects. 
 
 The light emitted from any object moving away from us causes the light to stretch. As shown in the diagram above, shorter wave lengths like [Ultraviolet, X-rays, and Gamma Rays](https://astrulabi.github.io/site/project/em-spectrum) are stretched into longer, "redder" wavelengths like visisble light, infrared, microwave, and radio. This is why many galaxies that are farther away can appear red despite their true nature.
