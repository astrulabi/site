 The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, which means that most distant extra-galactic objects in every direction are progressively moving away from us. This causes a phenomena known as redshift amongst these celestial objects. 
 
 The light emitted from any object moving away from us causes the light to stretch. Shorter wave lengths like [Ultraviolet, X-rays, and Gamma Rays](https://astrulabi.github.io/site/project/em-spectrum) are stretched into longer, "redder" wavelengths like visisble light, infrared, microwave, and radio. Thus, the fleeing objects may appear to be a colour with a longer wavelength.
